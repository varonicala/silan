        Tx post-check with Tx interrupt disabled, which reduces interrupts
        to the OS. Different from doing the Tx completion work when Tx complete
        interrupt is received, Tx post-check does the work likes below:
        When a packet has been started transmition,
            1) If the network interface is in napi scheduled state, we just do
        nothing as function "stmmac_poll" will call function "stmmac_tx" to finish
        the Tx completion work of the previous transmitted packet when a packet
        is received;
            2) If the network interface is NOT in napi scheduled state, then we
        start napi so that the Tx completion work of the previous transmitted
        packet will be done by function "stmmac_poll"
