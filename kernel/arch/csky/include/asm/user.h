/*
 *  Core file format: The core file is written in such a way that gdb
 *  can understand it and provide useful information to the user (under
 *  linux we use the 'trad-core' bfd).  There are quite a number of
 *  obstacles to being able to view the contents of the floating point
 *  registers, and until these are solved you will not be able to view the
 *  contents of them.  Actually, you can read in the core file and look at
 *  the contents of the user struct to find out what the floating point
 *  registers contain.
 *  The actual file contents are as follows:
 *  UPAGE: 1 page consisting of a user struct that tells gdb what is present
 *  in the file.  Directly after this is a copy of the task_struct, which
 *  is currently not used by gdb, but it may come in useful at some point.
 *  All of the registers are stored as part of the upage.  The upage should
 *  always be only one page.
 *  DATA: The data area is stored.  We use current->end_text to
 *  current->brk to pick up all of the user variables, plus any memory
 *  that may have been malloced.  No attempt is made to determine if a page
 *  is demand-zero or if a page is totally unused, we just cover the entire
 *  range.  All of the addresses are rounded in such a way that an integral
 *  number of pages is written.
 *  STACK: We need the stack information in order to get a meaningful
 *  backtrace.  We need to write the data from (esp) to
 *  current->start_stack, so we round each of these off in order to be able
 *  to write an integer number of pages.
 *  The minimum core file size is 3 pages, or 12288 bytes.
