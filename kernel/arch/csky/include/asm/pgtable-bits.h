/*
 * Note that we shift the lower 32bits of each EntryLo[01] entry
 * 6 bits to the left. That way we can convert the PFN into the
 * physical address by a single 'and' operation and gain 6 additional
 * bits for storing information which isn't present in a normal
 * CSKY page table.
 *
 * Similar to the Alpha port, we need to keep track of the ref
 * and mod bits in software.  We have a software "yeah you can read
 * from this page" bit, and a hardware one which actually lets the
 * process read from the page.  On the same token we have a software
 * writable bit and the real hardware one which actually lets the
 * process write to the page, this keeps a mod bit via the hardware
 * dirty bit.
 *
 * Certain revisions of the ck640 have a bug where if a
 * certain sequence occurs in the last 3 instructions of an executable
 * page, and the following page is not mapped, the cpu can do
 * unpredictable things.  The code (when it is written) to deal with
 * this problem will be in the update_mmu_cache() code for the r4k.
